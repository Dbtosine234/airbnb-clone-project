# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB platform.  
It aims to build a full web application including:
- A command interpreter for data management
- A front-end website
- A back-end API
- Database storage

The project is developed step-by-step to reinforce important software engineering concepts such as:
- Python scripting
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Web development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- RESTful APIs
- Database management with MySQL

## Project Goals
- Understand how a large project is structured and maintained.
- Learn to collaborate using GitHub.
- Build a scalable application using best practices.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (for back-end logic & API)
- **Flask** (web framework)
- **MySQL** (database)
- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript** (front-end)
- **Bootstrap** (styling)
- **Git & GitHub** (version control and collaboration)

## Technology Stack

The AirBnB Clone project is built with a modern and scalable set of technologies.
Each technology plays a specific role in delivering a functional and reliable system.

### 1. Django
- A high-level Python web framework used to build the application’s backend.
- Provides built-in tools for authentication, admin management, and ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
- Speeds up development while enforcing best practices.

### 2. PostgreSQL
- A powerful open-source relational database management system.
- Stores structured data such as users, properties, reservations, and payments.
- Provides scalability, security, and support for complex queries.

### 3. GraphQL
- A query language for APIs that enables clients to request only the data they need.
- Improves performance by reducing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
- Works alongside Django to deliver flexible API endpoints.

### 4. HTML5
- Used to structure the content of the front-end web pages.
- Provides semantic elements that make the website accessible and SEO-friendly.

### 5. CSS3
- Handles the styling and layout of the front-end interface.
- Ensures the application is visually appealing and responsive across devices.

### 6. JavaScript (ES6+)
- Adds interactivity and dynamic features to the web pages.
- Works with GraphQL to fetch and display live data from the backend.

### 7. Bootstrap
- A front-end framework that speeds up the design process with reusable UI components.
- Ensures a consistent, responsive design across multiple devices.

### 8. Git & GitHub
- Git: a version control system that tracks changes in the codebase.
- GitHub: a platform for collaboration, code review, and repository hosting.

### 9. Docker
- Provides containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- Ensures the app runs the same way on any system, avoiding dependency issues.
