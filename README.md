# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB platform.  
It aims to build a full web application including:
- A command interpreter for data management
- A front-end website
- A back-end API
- Database storage

The project is developed step-by-step to reinforce important software engineering concepts such as:
- Python scripting
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Web development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- RESTful APIs
- Database management with MySQL

## Project Goals
- Understand how a large project is structured and maintained.
- Learn to collaborate using GitHub.
- Build a scalable application using best practices.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (for back-end logic & API)
- **Flask** (web framework)
- **MySQL** (database)
- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript** (front-end)
- **Bootstrap** (styling)
- **Git & GitHub** (version control and collaboration)
